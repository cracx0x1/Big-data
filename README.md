# Big Data Lab Experiments

This repository contains all of my experiments that I have done during my Big Data lab practicals.

## Overview
In this repository, you will find:
- Code for working with distributed systems and Big Data tools.
- Practical implementations using frameworks like Hadoop, Spark, and Hive.
- Experimentation with large-scale data processing techniques.
- Sample datasets and scripts for Big Data analysis.
- Results and observations from different experiments.

## What is Big Data?
Big Data refers to extremely large datasets that are too complex and vast to be handled using traditional data processing methods. It encompasses structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data generated from various sources such as social media, sensors, devices, and transactions.

The three defining characteristics of Big Data are commonly referred to as the 3Vs:

1. Volume: The sheer scale of data generated.
2. Velocity: The speed at which data is created and processed.
3. Variety: The different types and formats of data.

Big Data is used in various applications, including:

1. Predictive analytics
2. Real-time monitoring
3. Personalized recommendations
4. Fraud detection.
